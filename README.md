I created a Trivia Game styled around Rick and Morty.
The basic layout uses HTML with a few bootstrap elements and some manual CSS styling.
The HTML is manipulated using jquery and javascript, primarily hiding and showing different elements and updating scorekeeping / timers.

I locked the timer in position within the viewport using fixed positioning, and upon either submitting or ending, it reacts dynamically.

I used two image files and allotted 30 seconds for the quiz timer.
